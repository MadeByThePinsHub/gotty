# Andrei Jiroh's GoTTY fork for Docker builds

> This fork has been archived as he moved the development for this fork to [`MadeByThePinsHub/gotty`](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/gotty). Same licensing applies as I don't want to get f**ked by DMCA for plagrizing code, while keeping the rest of docs to the upstream.

This fork is only used for [The Pins Team](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub)'s repos, especially on the [hc-vault-docker-template](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/hc-vault-docker-template) repo.

## Building from Source

**Legalese text**: [Original work](https://github.com/yudai/gotty) by [Iwasaki Yudai](https://github.com/yudai), which is now abandoned. There would be no GoTTY without him. ❤️ We used [this fork](https://github.com/sorenisanerd/gotty) currently maintained by [Soren L. Hansen](https://github.com/sorenisanerd)
