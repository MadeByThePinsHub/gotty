# Andrei Jiroh's GoTTY fork for Docker builds

> This fork has been archived as he moved the development for this fork to [`MadeByThePinsHub/gotty`](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/gotty). Same licensing applies as I don't want to get f**ked by DMCA for plagrizing code, while keeping the rest of docs to the upstream.

This fork is only used for [The Pins Team](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub)'s repos, especially on the [hc-vault-docker-template](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/hc-vault-docker-template) repo.

## Building from Source

### In Gitpod

1. [Open this repo](https://gitpod.io/#github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/gotty) in Gitpod. Sign in if prompted.
2. Once the build succeed, get the URL of web terminal with `gp url 8080`
3. Happy hacking!

## More Docs Stuff

[See the upstream's README](https://github.com/yudai/gotty) for the docs.

## TODOs

Since the upstream possibly abandoned the project, the work is on the forks like mine, so here are some of the backlog I have:

* [ ] Update old links from `github.com/codegangsta/cli` to `github.com/urfave/cli`
* [ ] Upgrade codebase to Golang 1.16.x, probably
* [ ] Write CI for unit testing and vunlerability scanning.
* [ ] Configure Dependabot for development toolchain and dependency upgrades.
